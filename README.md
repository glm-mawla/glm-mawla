I have a strong knowledge of Java and Kotlin languages, and I use MVP and MVVM design patterns, Bio-metric authentication, Coroutines, RxJava, RxKotlin, Material design, and third-party libraries to create user-friendly and efficient app features. I also have expertise in gRPC and data encryption and decryption techniques to ensure data security and integrity. 

I am passionate about learning new technologies and applying them to solve real-world problems. I am also a scrum and agile enthusiast and practitioner, and I enjoy collaborating with cross-functional teams to transform business requirements into mobile solutions.
